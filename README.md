## INSTALLATION STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
* Download MTGA Pro Tracker from our Github repo Releases section (https://github.com/Razviar/mtgap/releases ). Antivirus software (including Windows Defender) could be alarmed because of the app's ability to upload data to remote server and automatic update feature. So if Antivirus is alarmed, you should add this App to exceptions.
* Unpack it and launch EXE Installer.
* Sync your account using respective button in the app interface.

## Windows protected your PC?
When you get mesage "Windows protected your PC", you should click "More Info..." and "Run Anyway". Defender gets alarmed because application is not known enough. After several scans, it will calm down and let you use Tracker. 

## TRACKER IS NOT UPDATING?
App crashes or not starting? No recent updates uploaded? Follow steps:

1. Make sure you have latest version. It's updated to be compatible with latest MTGA version.
